The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, when using it with multiple units, unexpected results can occur if the units are not consistent. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine because we are subtracting pixels from a percentage, but `width: calc(50% - 20em);` might not render as expected because it is subtracting ems from a percentage. The browser may not correctly handle the unit conversion.
